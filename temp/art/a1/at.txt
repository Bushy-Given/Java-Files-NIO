To find out which films have been the most critically acclaimed over time, Business Insider turned to the reviews aggregator Metacritic for this ranking, which scores films by their composite critical reception.

The resulting list includes modern masterpieces like recent Oscar winners "Moonlight" and "Parasite" in contention with classics like "The Godfather" and "Citizen Kane."

There's also, not surprisingly, a lot of Hitchcock.
